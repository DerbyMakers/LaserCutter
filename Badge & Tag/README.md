Badge & Tag
==========
Badges are given to all members so they are easily identified. The dxf files will be stored in this directory

Tags are placed on the laser cutter so we have a visual queue and know who is using the laser cutter and who is next in line.

**NOTE:** *You MUST remember to convert the text on each file into a path, otherwise it will not cut properly.*
